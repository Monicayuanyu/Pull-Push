        <p>The plateau is hectic </p>
        <p>with anemones, broken</p>
        <p>mirror orchids, caper-quakes</p>
        <p>beestung irises by the chipped</p>
        <p>blue hive, the antioxidant horta.</p>
        
        <p> Also a poem</p>
        <p>The soote season, that bud and blome furth bringes</p>
        <p>With grene hath clad the hill and eke the vale</p>
        <p>The nightingale with fethers new she singes</p>
        <p>The turtle to her make hath tolde her tale</p>
